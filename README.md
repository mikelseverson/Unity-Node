# Unity Node Project

Currently the goal of this project is to experiment with Unity.

Node.js will be running the backend.

Since I don't have any experience with unity - The project is not scoped out.

There is one thing I do know about the project...

Multiplayer is a necessity.

Project put on hold until Aug 15.
